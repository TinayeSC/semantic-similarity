# semantic-similarity
 This project explored semantic similarity using spacy. The file semantic.py is a cheat sheet and so is example.py. They illustrate the different uses I have learnt for semantic similarity using spacy. The requirements.txt file will work for all the files, since they use all the same modules. I suggest you run the below codes to run watch_next.py using docker. The file watch_next.py conatins a function that will recommend a movie to watch after processing a descrpition of another movie and calculating how similar a list of movies are to this watched movie. 

docker build -t watch-next ./
docker run watch-next

After you have run these docker commands you can paste these into the terminal:

python semantic.py 

python example.py 

if you wish to run them. However, the comments of these two files are meant to be read for this task, so I suggest openning the files in VS code.
